# monkey-interpreter
Following along with the book ***Writing an interpreter in Go*** by Thorsten Ball.

The aim is to create a mock programming language - named Monkey. And thus also create an interpreter. You can interact with the language via a REPL, once code is executed it will be tokenised, parsed and finally a result will be calculated as output.

Written completely in Go as guided throughout the book.
